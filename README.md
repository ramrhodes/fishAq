Data & Model by Jess Couture, PhD candidate at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management

Jess's model is a 1-D spatially explicit bioeconomic model that simulates fish movement and fishery catches around a protected space. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a marine protected area or farm on wild populations (abundance, biomass) and fishery catches (yield amount and yield biomass).
