Shiny App built by Rachel Rhodes and Laurel Wee for ESM 244

Data & Model by Jess Couture, PhD candidate at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management

Jess's model is a 1-D spatially explicit bioeconomic model that simulates fish movement and fishery catches around a protected space. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a marine protected area or farm on wild populations (abundance, biomass) and fishery catches (yield amount and yield biomass). 

NOTE: the current ShinyApp uses dummy data from the dyplr:: package called 'storms' as we are waiting on data from Jess. This will be updated in the next week or two.
